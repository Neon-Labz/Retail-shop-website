/* RTL Demo homepage — an exact section-for-section replica of the Default
   Fashion homepage (same components, same order, same data, same
   animations/interactions), rendered with dir="rtl" and an Arabic-capable
   font (Cairo) applied throughout the page body. Only two things differ from
   src/app/page.tsx: the dir="rtl"/lang="ar" wrapper and the font. Every
   section below is the literal same component Default Fashion uses — no
   forked/rebuilt section components — so layout, sections, animations and
   functionality are identical by construction, not by re-implementation.

   Global overlays (CartDrawer, SearchDrawer, QuickViewModal, CompareBar,
   Footer, MobileBottomNav, ScrollToTop) are mounted in the root layout as
   siblings of this page, not descendants — they do not inherit dir="rtl"
   from this wrapper and keep their existing, fully-functional LTR
   presentation, exactly as they do for every other storefront on the site. */
